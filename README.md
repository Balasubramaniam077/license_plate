# Number Plate Tracking & Safety System

# Project Overview

This project was developed for a freelancing client and focuses on real-time vehicle number plate recognition and safety management using advanced technologies. It provides an efficient, automated solution to enhance road safety by tracking vehicles and monitoring safety compliance.

Features
Number Plate Recognition
The system is powered by Python, Flask, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to accurately track and extract vehicle number plates. It includes an automated email notification system that sends alerts when a new vehicle is identified. The data seamlessly integrates with a database for further analysis.

Real-Time Safety Management
The project implements safety features like helmet detection and pillion rider monitoring to ensure compliance with safety regulations. This enhances road safety by identifying riders who are not adhering to safety protocols.

Embedded System Deployment
The solution was deployed on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform, which ensures efficient real-time processing and management. This enables the system to perform tasks locally, offering low latency and high efficiency.

# Technologies Used
Python
For backend logic and system integration.

Flask
To create the web framework and API endpoints.

OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
For reading and extracting vehicle number plate information.

NVIDIA Jetson Nano
For real-time processing on an embedded system.

# Future Enhancements
Integration with cloud-based storage for large-scale deployment.
Implementation of additional safety compliance checks for vehicles.
